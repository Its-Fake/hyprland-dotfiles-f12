.SH NAME
.PP
wvkbd - on-screen virtual keyboard for wayland compositors using wlroots
.PP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
wvkbd-mobintl [OPTIONS].\&.\&.\&
wvkbd-deskintl [OPTIONS].\&.\&.\&
.PP
\fBNOTE\fR: Your binary may have a different suffix depending on which layout you compiled.\&
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This project aims to deliver a minimal but practically usable implementation of
a wlroots on-screen keyboard in legible C.\& This will \fIonly\fR be a keyboard, not
a feedback buzzer, led blinker, or anything that requires more than what'\&s
needed to input text quickly.\& The end product should be a static codebase that
can be patched to add new features.\&

.SH COMPOSE BUTTON
.PP
The default mobile international layout features a Compose button (\fBCmp\fR)
which, when combined with another key, opens up a layout that offers variants
for that key.\& This is similar to functionality that other keyboards implemented
using a \fBlong press\fR (wvkbd has no such notion, holding a key will repeat
it like on a physical keyboard).\&
.PP
For example, press Cmp + a to access variants with diacritics like á,à,â,ä, etc.\&.\& 
.PP
Most layouts also feature the following that are less obvious:
.PP
.PD 0
.IP \(bu 4
Press Cmp and .\& to access more punctuation
.IP \(bu 4
Press Cmp and - or , to access '\&mathematical'\& symbols (+,-,=,etc)
.IP \(bu 4
Press Cmp and '\& or 0 or 9 to access more brackets and quotes
.IP \(bu 4
Press Cmp and q to access emojis
.PD
.PP
Last, but not least, pressing Cmp + space or Cmp + ⌨  or Cmp + Abc opens up an
index that allows you to immediately jump to any layout by name, even layouts
not explicitly added to your layers on startup.\&
